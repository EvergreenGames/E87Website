   <h2>Companies</h2>
   <p>
   Now that almost every bussiness uses technology in some way like the internet, it is safe to say that most businesses need someone with knowledge in Computer Science
   even if it is purely for creating a web page and keep it updated. That is why most companies hire at least one person with a Computer Science degree. It doesn't matter what sector it is; the Government sector, Health sector,
   Energy Industry, Financial sector, Transportation, Retail Companies, they all need some sort of service from Computer Scientists.
   </p>
   <p>
     Some examples of Companies are:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <img src="Gapps.jpg" alt="Google Apps" style="width:250px;height:140px;margin:2px 30px;" align="right">
     <li> <b>Google</b> </li>
    <p>
    Their mission as a company is "to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful." If their mission sounds appealing to you, you might be happy working in Google.
    It is one of the most popular companies among Computer Science students, you can work as a Software Engineer, Test Engineer, Security/Privacy Engineer, Data Sientist and much more! They look for people with a B.S. in Computer Science,
    experience with more than one programming language and some of the soft skills such as interpersonal and writing skills. You could contribute to new features in Youtube, create a whole new app, help with the security of users' private 
    information and many other interesting projects at Google. <a href="https://careers.google.com/" target="_blank"> More information </a>

     <p>
       Their mission is to "protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States." As a Federal Agency they have some extra requirements since you could be dealing with delicate information so you would require top clearances as 
       well as a background check. You can be an FBI Computer Scientist, IT Specialist - Forensic Examiner, Software Engineer, Cryptanalyst, and much more. They look for people with a Computer Science B.S. who can work in a fast-paced environment and can keep up 
       with their tasks such as identifying threats, recovering information that was deleted, and keep learning to keep up with those evolving threats. You could help keep America safe and keep up with new technology as well as knowing some facts that might not be
       known by the general public. <a href="https://www.fbijobs.gov/career-paths/stem" target="_blank"> More information </a>
