     Computer Science is a field with a large range of career options that keeps growing every day. For example, Artificial Inteligence, it was and it is still a developing field as the article "The Learning Machines" explains how the Google X lab made huge contributions to AI using deep-learning and how companies like Apple and IBM where competing to get people with that knowledge in their team.
     This is proof of how Computer Science is still developing since there are plenty of things that aren't discovered or finalized yet, which is great since one major can lead you to many different jobs and if you don't like one, don't worry! There are plenty more options. Some of these options are:

   <h2>Companies</h2>
   <p>
   Now that almost every bussiness uses technology in some way like the internet, it is safe to say that most businesses need someone with knowledge in Computer Science
   even if it is purely for creating a web page and keep it updated. That is why most companies hire at least one person with a Computer Science degree. It doesn't matter what sector it is; the Government sector, Health sector,
   Energy Industry, Financial sector, Transportation, Retail Companies, they all need some sort of service from Computer Scientists.
   </p>
    <!-- list of companies who hire computer scientists along with pictures, small description and links-->
   <p>
     Some examples of Companies are:
   </p>
   <ul>
     <img src="Gapps.jpg" alt="Google Apps" style="width:250px;height:140px;margin:2px 30px;" align="right">
     <li> <b>Google</b> </li>
    <p>
    Their mission as a company is "to organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful." If their mission sounds appealing to you, you might be happy working in Google, where according to the article "Looking into The Google Legacy" published by Information Today, they are expanding beyond search to create new apps like they did with Google Maps which means that their projects will most likely be very exciting.
    Google is one of the most popular companies among Computer Science students, you can work as a Software Engineer, Test Engineer, Security/Privacy Engineer, Data Sientist and much more! They look for people with a B.S. in Computer Science,
    experience with more than one programming language and some of the soft skills such as interpersonal and writing skills. You could contribute to new features in Youtube, create a whole new app, help with the security of users' private 
    information and many other interesting projects at Google. <a href="https://careers.google.com/" target="_blank"> More information </a>

     <p>
       Their mission is to "protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States." As a Federal Agency they have some extra requirements since you could be dealing with delicate information so you would require top clearances as 
       well as a background check. You can be an FBI Computer Scientist, IT Specialist - Forensic Examiner, Software Engineer, Cryptanalyst, and much more. They look for people with a Computer Science B.S. who can work in a fast-paced environment and can keep up 
       with their tasks such as identifying threats, recovering information that was deleted, and keep learning to keep up with those evolving threats. You could help keep America safe and keep up with new technology as well as knowing some facts that might not be
       known by the general public. <a href="https://www.fbijobs.gov/career-paths/stem" target="_blank"> More information </a>

       projects that will most likely have an impact on a lot of people around the world. They look for people from all the backgrounds and a Computer Science major is appreciated in many of their teams such as the Software Engineering, Security, Research, Data and Analytics, Oculus, Instagram, and many more.
       You could be protecting users' private information, improving the apps, working on the VR software and many other fun and important projects. All engineers go through Engineering Bootcamp where they learn more about the company and the teams so you can identify the team that you would like to be a part of.
