    <!--I had some h3 tags discussing engineering in general and some fun facts about it-->
    <h3>Engineering by definition is "the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures"</h3>
    <h3>More broadly, engineering is about helping others.</h3>
    <h3>Engineering is about innovating and creating solutions that are useful to other people.</h3>
    <h3>Engineers apply math, science, and technology to solve problems faced by others.</h3>

    <h3>Here are some examples of types of engineering:</h3>
    <!--Ordered List of some lesser known types of engineering-->
    <ol>
        <li>
            Environmental Engineering: <br>
            •Involves the study and research of how to improve our environment as well as the impact humans have on the environment. 
            <br>•Considered a subset of civil engineering.
        </li>
        <li>
            Agricultural Engineering: <br>
            •Applies engineering discipline to the agricultural industry. 
            <br> •Topics of study include soil conservation, irrigation, farm machine design, ground preparation, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sustainability Engineering: 
            <br> •There are three major categories of sustainability: Environmental impact, social consideration, and economic consideration. 
            <br> •Work after getting the degree may include hazardous waste management, emission control, wastewater management, and more. 
        </li>
