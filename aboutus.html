			<p>I am actually not a CS Major, but instead I am an Electrical Engineering major. I chose Electrical Engineering for many reasons, mostly because
				I really like hardware. Back in Junior High School, I got introduced with hardware in a small workshop class, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
				We got some experience with breadboards, sautering, and circuits. After this class, I knew I wanted to work with hardware more
				and so when I applied to UCLA, I applied as an Electrical Engineering major!

			I chose Engineering because nothing else excites me more. I don't have a specific reason but when I think about Computer Science
			I just feel like it is right for me. I like challenges, freedom, and I hate routine or monotony. Computer Science is a field that
			keeps growing so it can definitely keep me busy learning all the new things and I can also create those changes. Also, since there are 
			so many things you can do with code I feel like if I get bored of web pages or mobile apps, I can simply apply my knowledge somewhere else 
			like cybersecurity or Data Analysis. As of right now, I think I'm leaning towards Cybersecurity but you never know, maybe after a few
			quarters I will change my mind and the fact that I can change my focus without much trouble is exactly what I was looking for. I am not one
			of those people who have a plan for their future but I can confidently say that I like it so far and I can see myself coding for my next 
			50 years without problem.

			<p>I have always enjoyed problem solving and logical thinking, so I chose to be an engineer to be able to solve problems in a professional context. I always knew I wanted to be a stem major of some sort. My dad is a programmer, and he introduced me to computers. When I began to learn programming, I found that I really enjoyed it, and so I chose to major in CS. One day, I hope to work as a game developer, using programming in a creative context.</p>

			<p>I chose Engineering, and CS in specific because of multiple reasons. My Dad is a EE major and engineer, so I always looked up to him and wanted to go into a 			similar field, especially because of all the time I spent bonding with him when he helped me with STEM homework, or simply explained some concept to me about 				science. Another reason is my love of racing and Formula 1. I have been a racing and Formula 1 fan for a years, and the amount of technology that goes into the cars 			always amazed me, and made me want to pursue engineering. Finally, I chose CS specifically because of the versatility it provides. Almost any company needs 				programmers because most companies have websites, apps, etc. This makes for more career opportunities, and areas of focus. </p>
