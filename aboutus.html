			I chose Engineering because nothing else excites me more. I don't have a specific reason but when I think about Computer Science
			I just feel like it is right for me. I like challenges, freedom, and I hate routine or monotony. Computer Science is a field that
			keeps growing so it can definitely keep me busy learning all the new things and I can also create those changes. Also, since there are 
			so many things you can do with code I feel like if I get bored of web pages or mobile apps, I can simply apply my knowledge somewhere else 
			like cybersecurity or Data Analysis. As of right now, I think I'm leaning towards Cybersecurity but you never know, maybe after a few
			quarters I will change my mind and the fact that I can change my focus without much trouble is exactly what I was looking for. I am not one
			of those people who have a plan for their future but I can confidently say that I like it so far and I can see myself coding for my next 
			50 years without problem.
