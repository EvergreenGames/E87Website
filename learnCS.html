    <h1> Learn CS </h1>
    <br>
    <h3>CS is a popular major that can be studied at almost any university</h3>
    <h3>Many fields can be explored in CS during the time in college, including similar majors like Computer Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering</h3>

     <h3> These skills and more are required to complete a undergraduate computer science degree </h3>
    <h3>Skills:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
          	 Problem-Solving Skills: One must be able to solve different types of problems in the most efficient and understandable way. This requires different approaches for different problems. 
      
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
		Creativity: Creative methods must be implemented in most if not all cases to be able to solve challenges in new ways. This means both thinking about situations in different ways, and applying past knowledge and
		strategies to new problems in different ways.
            <br><br>
		
        </li>
        <li>
		Teamwork: Teamwork and collaboration is especially crucial when pursuing a degree in cs. The only way to solve many problem sets and understand concepts is to be able to help, and be helped by peers
          
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
		Algorithmic Thinking: Being able to think about the systematic nature of computer programs. Being able to break down a problem into steps that can be processed by a computer           
            <br><br>
        </li>
    </ol>



   
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>There are also many opportunities in the work field in CS, and many skills are necessary there too</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
          	Programming Languages: Knowing multiple programming languages is an incredible strength, allowing prospective employees to work
		on different codebases. And because each language is designed for different application, this skill is necessary since one language
		does not fit all.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
           	Interviewing: In such an impacted field, to be able to succeed in industry and gain employment opportunities, one must be able to
		interview well. This includes being articulate, professional, and being able to handle coding challenges on the spot in front of an employer
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
		Understanding Code: Much of the code that is used by employees at a company is already made, this poses a challenge for engineers because they
		must not only understand the code that has already been written, but write their code to work with the existing codebase.
            <br><br>
