    <h1> About Engineering </h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Engineering by definition is "the branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures"</h3>
    <h3>More broadly, engineering is about helping others.</h3>
    <h3>Engineering is about innovating and creating solutions that are useful to other people.</h3>
    <h3>Engineers apply math, science, and technology to solve problems faced by others.</h3>

    <h1> About CS </h1>
    <br>
    <h3>CS, or Computer Science, is the study of computers and computation systems. </h3>
    <h3>Computer Science mostly deals with software, such as programming, which is different from Electrical Engineering for example, which deals mostly with hardware.</h3>
    <h3>In Computer Science, there are many key areas of focus, such as: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Artificial Intelligence:</h3>Artificial Intelligence, or Machine Intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence and 
            human action. <br>
            AI is a large, growing field in technology. 
        </li>
        <li>Cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Computer Systems and Networks</li>
        <li>Vision and Graphics</li>
        <li>Database Systems</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>One important aspect about CS is the salary:</h3>
