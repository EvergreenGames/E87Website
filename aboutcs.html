    <h3>CS, or Computer Science, is the study of computers and computational systems. </h3>
    <h3>Computer Science mostly deals with software, such as programming, which is different from Electrical Engineering for example, which deals mostly with hardware.</h3>
    <h3>In Computer Science, there are many key areas of focus, such as: </h3>
    <!--This is an ordered list with some areas of focus of cs-->
    <ol>
        <li>
            Artificial Intelligence
        </li>
        <li>Cybersecurity</li>
