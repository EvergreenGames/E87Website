    <h1> About CS </h1>
    <br>
    <h3>CS, or Computer Science, is the study of computers and computational systems. </h3>
    <h3>Computer Science mostly deals with software, such as programming, which is different from Electrical Engineering for example, which deals mostly with hardware.</h3>
    <h3>In Computer Science, there are many key areas of focus, such as: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Artificial Intelligence
        </li>
        <li>Cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Computer Systems and Networks</li>
        <li>Vision and Graphics</li>
        <li>Database Systems</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Link and describe at least 4 professional organizations.</h3>
    <h3>Professional Computer Science Organizations</h3>
